#### Who am I? 

My name is Tran Tuan Minh; Security Researcher.

I was coding in highschool since 2012. I studied Informatics in High School for Gifted Student (VNU) and Computer Science in University of Engineering & Technology (VNU).

I'm currently working at Viettel Cyber Security. My works are related with Malware & Software Exploitation. In my free time, I play CTFs. I'm a member in several CTF-teams like UET-N/A (UET-CTF), PiggyBird, AceBear, BabyPhD, PwnPHOFun.

I started blogging to share my CTF writeups and IT-related stuffs in general. It becomes more and more complicated so the blog evolves itself into this form.

You may want to make contact with me to:
1. Request a tutorial or writeup.
2. Send a job description.
3. Report an error somewhere in this blog.
4. Buy me a beer üç∫

I will take time to respond to any emails I may receive; however, I will block you if you spam my inbox.
